# CS-230


  The client for this project was The Gaming Room. They wanted to create a web applicaiton for their game that would support the amount of players. The clinet wanted ot expand their game from Android only to the web applicaion, so it would be more accessible. 
    Although all of my work on this project can be improved with more experience, the part that I feel I did well with the pros and cons on the chart for the different operating systems. This helped with recommending an operating systems based on the specific needs of the client. This was also helpful with working with the code. 
    If I could choose one part of my work to revise, it would be the chart. While I feel I did it kind of well, there can be more added to it, I'm sure. 
    The user's needs was the most important aspect of this project. I interpreted them as something I always needed to keep in mind. This is important because in the end, this if for the clinet and should be how they wanted and expected it to be. 
    I approached the designing software with on open mind. I like to look at the whole thing before working on it so I can get a bigger picture of where everything is. In the future, I think using a psudocode would be extremely helpful when analyzing and designing similar software applicaions.
